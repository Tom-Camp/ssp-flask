  <p>The SSP Toolkit is used to create System Security Plans using components
  and templates. Components, appendices, and frontmatter can be added to a
  project and edited. Key YAML files containing variables that can be used
  to populate the variables in the templates can be edited and created.</p>

  <p>You can create a Project here or clone a git repository of Project files
  in the project_data directory. Any directory in the project_directory that
  includes a project.yaml file will be accessible in the Toolkit.</p>
